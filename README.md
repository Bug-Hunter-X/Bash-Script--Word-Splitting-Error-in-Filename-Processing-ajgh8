This repository contains a bash script that illustrates a common error related to word splitting and provides a corrected version. Word splitting is a feature of bash that splits strings into individual words based on whitespace. This behavior can lead to unexpected results when processing filenames or strings that contain spaces. The script demonstrates both the incorrect and correct ways to handle filenames with spaces using bash. The incorrect version shows how word splitting can cause the loop to iterate over each word instead of the entire filename, while the correct version demonstrates how to avoid this issue by using arrays.
